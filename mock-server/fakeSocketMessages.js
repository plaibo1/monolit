            '*Query Complexity:* MEDIUM\n\n*Execution Strategy:* SEQUENTIAL\n\n*Tools (3):* `polymarket_query`, `polymarket_info_query`, `resolver_worker_query`\n\n*Initial Confidence:* 70.0%\n\n---\n\n*Reasoning:* # Strategic Execution Plan\n\n## 1. Primary Objective and Sub-objectives\n\n**Primary Objective:** Retrieve Polymarket prediction markets that expire within the next month, including market slugs and all available fields.\n\n**Sub-objectives:**\n- Identify all active Polymarket prediction markets\n- Filter markets by expiration date (within next month)\n- Retrieve comprehensive market data including slugs and all available fields\n- Ensure technical data about these markets is complete\n\n## 2. Required Information Sources\n\n**Primary Tools:**\n- `polymarket_query`: To retrieve comprehensive market data including expiration dates\n- `polymarket_info_query`: To get additional technical details about specific markets\n\n**Supporting Tool:**\n- `resolver_worker_query`: May be needed for data processing if the result set is large\n\n## 3. Execution Strategy\n\n**Sequential Execution (Moderate Complexity):**\n1. First, use `polymarket_query` to get all active markets with expiration dates\n2. Then, filter the results to identify markets expiring within the next month\n3. If needed, use `polymarket_info_query` to enrich the data with additional technical details\n\n## 4. Dependencies\n\n- The `polymarket_info_query` depends on the results from the initial `polymarket_query` as it requires market identifiers\n- Data filtering operations depend on having accurate timestamp data from the initial query\n\n## 5. Expected Challenges and Fallback Strategies\n\n**Potential Challenges:**\n- Large result set may require pagination or chunking\n- Expiration date format might need standardization\n- Some markets might have incomplete data\n\n**Fallback Strategies:**\n- If `polymarket_query` returns too many results, implement pagination\n- If expiration date filtering is challenging, use `resolver_worker_query` to process the data\n- If specific markets have incomplete data, use `polymarket_info_query` to fill gaps\n\n## 6. Success Criteria\n\n- Complete dataset containing all Polymarket prediction markets expiring within the next month\n- Each market record includes the market slug and all available fields\n- Technical data is complete and accurate\n- Results are properly formatted for user consumption\n\n## Execution Approach\n\nThis is a **moderate complexity query** requiring sequential execution with 2-3 tools:\n\n1. **Initial Data Retrieval:**\n   ```\n   polymarket_query(\n     query_type: "markets",\n     filter: {\n       status: "active"\n     },\n     fields: ["slug", "question", "description", "expiresAt", "volume", "liquidity", "categories", "outcomes", "url", "createdAt", "resolutionSource", "isResolved"]\n   )\n   ```\n\n2. **Data Filtering:**\n   Filter results to include only markets where expiresAt is between current date and current date + 30 days\n\n3. **Enrichment (if needed):**\n   For each market in filtered results, use `polymarket_info_query` to get additional technical details\n\nThis plan addresses both detected intentions:\n- PREDICTION_MARKETS (90.0%): By retrieving comprehensive Polymarket data\n- TECHNICAL_DATA (60.0%): By ensuring all technical fields are included and potentially enriching with `polymarket_info_query`',

Today is November 19, 2025, so yesterday would be November 18, 2025.\n\nLet me analyze the available tools:\n\n1. **CEX_QUERY** - Can query `cex.bybit_kline` table which contains OHLCV candlestick data with close_price for specific tickers. This is what I need for Bitcoin price.\n\n2. **CEX_TICKER_INFO_QUERY** - Needed to get the `ticker_id` for BTC/BTCUSDT first, before I can query the kline data.\n\n3. **CEX_LISTINGS_QUERY** - Not relevant for historical price data.\n\n4. **RESOLVER_WORKER_QUERY** - General token resolver, but not specifically for historical CEX prices.\n\n**Strategy:**\n1. First, I need to get the ticker_id for Bitcoin using CEX_TICKER_INFO_QUERY with symbol='BTC' or 'BTCUSDT'\n2. Then, use that ticker_id to query CEX_QUERY on cex.bybit_kline table for November 18, 2025 (yesterday) to get the close_price\n\nThe execution notes say \"Previous attempts: - cex_ticker_info_query: success (score: 1.0)\" - which means we already successfully got the ticker info! This suggests we already know the ticker_id for BTC.\n\nHowever, to be thorough and follow best practices, I should:\n1. Query CEX_TICKER_INFO_QUERY to get the ticker_id for BTC (this may have already been done)\n2. Query CEX_QUERY with that ticker_id for November 18, 2025 data\n\nLet me provide a clear recommendation for both steps with the proper parameters.",
